<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am André Codea, an aspiring Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Python, 
    SQL, and data visualization, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Gran Faculdade (2023-2027).
     My passion lies in leveraging machine learning, data engineering, and business intelligence to drive data-driven solutions. 
     I thrive in fast-paced environments, where I can apply my adaptability and quick learning skills to solve complex problems.</p>

<p>With a technical skill set that includes Python, JavaScript, SQL, Power BI, and various machine learning 
    libraries like Scikit Learn and TensorFlow, I have developed several projects that showcase my ability to analyze and interpret data effectively. 
    Some of my notable projects include building a Breast Cancer Prediction Model using microRNA data, analyzing customer churn data to improve retention strategies,
     and predicting real estate rental prices in São Paulo using regression models.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical expertise, I have gained practical experience in inventory management
     and logistics as a Stock Manager at Sabor e Arte Refeições LTDA, where I optimized product storage and streamlined workflows.
      My previous role as a Legal Intern at JusMiranda further honed my analytical and organizational skills, 
      where I managed complex spreadsheets and assisted in drafting legal documents.</p>

<p>I am deeply interested in Machine Learning Engineering, Industrial Automations, 
    Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence, and I am always eager to explore new technologies like Quantum Computing. 
    I am fluent in both Portuguese and English, which allows me to collaborate effectively in diverse teams.</p>

<p>I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth, 
    as evidenced by my certifications in Project Management and Data Administration, 
    as well as my ongoing participation in Data Science bootcamps and courses.
     My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that harness the power of data to create impactful solutions.</p>
